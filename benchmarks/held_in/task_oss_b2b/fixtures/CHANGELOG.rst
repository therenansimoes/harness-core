Changelog
=========

Versions follow `CalVer <http://www.calver.org/>`_ with the scheme ``YY.0M.Micro``.

Unreleased
----------
Fixed
~~~~~
* Validate the whole BIC string when checking its structure. Previously the
  check was only anchored at the start, so an 11-character BIC with
  non-alphanumeric characters in the branch code (e.g. ``GENODEM1@#%``) was
  accepted and even exposed the garbage through ``BIC.branch_code``
  `@gaoflow <https://github.com/gaoflow>`_.
* Fixed the German checksum method ``16``. It was computed over account
  positions ``6-9`` (copied from method ``15``), but per the Bundesbank
  specification method ``16`` is computed like method ``06`` over positions
  ``1-9``; only method ``15`` is restricted to positions ``6-9``. Valid IBANs
  for banks using method ``16`` (e.g. Hanseatic Bank) were wrongly rejected.
* Fixed the German checksum method ``08`` threshold. Per the Bundesbank
  specification the check digit is only applied from account number ``60000``
  upward, but the threshold was set to ``6000``. Accounts in the
  ``[6000, 60000)`` range for banks using method ``08`` (e.g. NRW.BANK,
  Helaba) were wrongly rejected.
  `@chuenchen309 <https://github.com/chuenchen309>`_.


`2026.07.1`_ - 2026/07/06
-------------------------
Fixed
~~~~~
* Reverted changes to Italian bank registry due to invalid bank codes being added.


`2026.07.0`_ - 2026/07/02
-------------------------
Added
~~~~~
* Added Yemen (``YE``) to the IBAN registry so Yemeni IBANs can be parsed and
  validated (#294) `@CedricConday <https://github.com/CedricConday>`_.

Fixed
~~~~~
* Registered the ISO 7064 mod 97-10 national checksum algorithm for Bosnia and
  Herzegovina (``BA``) instead of ``BT`` (Bhutan, which has no IBAN), so the
  national checksum of ``BA`` IBANs is now validated (#264) `@CedricConday <https://github.com/CedricConday>`_.
* Fix BBAN pickle and deepcopy failures `@gaoflow <https://github.com/gaoflow>`_.
* Return ``True`` from ``validate_national_checksum`` on success `@gaoflow <https://github.com/gaoflow>`_.

Updated
~~~~~~~
* Update bank registries for Germany, Italy and Poland.


`2026.03.0`_ - 2026/03/04
-------------------------
Added
~~~~~
* Added bank registry for Moldova (MD) with 10 commercial banks.
* Extended bank registries for Great Britain, Spain and Romania.
* Added Revolut and Trade Republic to Spanish bank registry.

Changed
~~~~~~~
* Updated bank registries and updated them to format v2 for Switzerland, Poland,
  Austria and Finnland.
  The v2-format groups entries that have the same name and BIC and aggregates the
  matching bank codes. This reduces the file-size by up to 75%.

Internal
~~~~~~~~
* Update tooling and switch to PEP-735 compliant dependency groups.
* Use `uv` to manage Python versions instead of `flox`.


`2026.01.0`_ - 2026/01/23
-------------------------
Changed
~~~~~~~
* Removed support for deprecated Python version 3.9
* Updated local bank registries

Added
~~~~~
* Adding Revolut Bank UAB `@bitshift <https://github.com/bitshift>`_.

Fixed
~~~~~
* Fix Modulr Finance `@bitshift <https://github.com/bitshift>`_.


`2025.09.0`_ - 2025/09/22
-------------------------
Added
~~~~~
* Added bank registry for Liechtenstein.

Fixed
~~~~~
* The Polish IBAN format override was breaking down the bank code in an unusual way, which made it
  hard to generate IBANs from the components known to the user. This has been detected and fixed
  by `@pywkm <https://github.com/pywkm>`_.


`2025.07.0`_ - 2025/07/28
-------------------------
Changed
~~~~~~~
* Allow lax validation of ``IBAN`` values when used with Pydantic

  .. code-block:: python

    from typing import Annotated
    from typing import Field
    from pydantic import BaseModel


    class Model(BaseModel):
      iban: Annotated[IBAN, Field(strict=False)]

* Updated bank registry for Germany, Autstria, Switzerland and Poland.

Fixed
~~~~~

`2025.06.0`_ - 2025/06/25
-------------------------
Changed
~~~~~~~
* Allow country specific components to be passed to ``IBAN.generate()``.

  .. code-block:: pycon

    >>> IBAN.generate("IS", bank_code="0101", account_type="26", account_code="85002", account_holder_id="5402696029")
    <IBAN=IS910101260850025402696029>

* Updated the bank registries for Austria, Germany, Poland, Netherlands, Spain, Czech Republic,
  Italy, and Switzerland.

Added
~~~~~
* New French Banks `@Natim <https://github.com/Natim>`_
* Add modulr bank to Spanish bank registry `@jose-reveni <https://github.com/jose-reveni>`_

`2024.09.0`_ - 2024/09/31
-------------------------
Fixed
~~~~~
* Fix Python 3.8 support while it is still supported (EOL is 2024-10) (thanks to `@bwoodsend <https://github.com/bwoodsend>`_)

`2024.08.1`_ - 2024/08/13
-------------------------
Added
~~~~~
* Allow ``BIC`` and ``IBAN`` objects to be deepcopied (thanks to `@binaryDiv <https://github.com/binaryDiv>`_
  for pointing this out).

`2024.08.0`_ - 2024/08/13
-------------------------
Added
~~~~~
* Added French Polynesian banks to the registry `@tut-tuuut <https://github.com/tut-tuuut>`_
* Added bnext to the Spanish registry `@jose-reveni <https://github.com/jose-reveni>`_

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Updated the Belgian bank registry `@sennbos <https://github.com/sennebos>`_
* Updated bank registries for Austria, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Italy, Norway
  and Netherlands.

`2024.06.1`_ - 2024/06/10
-------------------------
Fixed
~~~~~
* The ``BIC.from_bank_code`` now handles banks correctly that have no value for the BIC field in the
  registry.

Changed
~~~~~~~
* Use ``hatch fmt`` and ``hatch test`` commands for internal development.

`2024.06.0`_ - 2024/06/04
-------------------------
Changed
~~~~~~~
* Stop using the "elfprooef" algorithm when validating Dutch IBANs, since the administrative
  authority says it should not be checked any more.

`2024.05.4`_ - 2024/05/25
-------------------------
Added
~~~~~
* The ``IBAN`` and ``BBAN`` classes now have an additional property ``currency_code`` for countries
  like Seychelles, Guatemala or Mauritius.

Fixed
~~~~~
* Also allow the BIC lookup for non-primary banks. For countries like Switzerland the lookup did
  fail for banks which did not have the primary-flag set, even though an appropriate mapping was
  available.
* ``IBAN.random()`` now also works for countries which have a currency code included in their BBAN
  e.g. Mauritius or Seychelles.
* ``IBAN.random()`` now also works for aspirational countries, where no information of the BBAN
  structure is available, e.g. Comoros.

`2024.05.3`_ - 2024/05/10
-------------------------
Added
~~~~~
* There is a new classmethod ``IBAN.random()`` that allows you to create random, but valid IBANs.

  .. code-block:: pycon

    >>> IBAN.random()
    <IBAN=LT435012771675726758>

  You can narrow down the generated values by providing the corresponding parameters to this
  function. E.g. to get only Spanish IBANs you can do

  .. code-block:: pycon

    >>> IBAN.random(country_code="ES")
    <IBAN=ES8801253179194914182449>

Changed
~~~~~~~
* Some missing bank associations have been added to the Portoguese bank registry by
  `@tiagoafseixas <https://github.com/tiagoafseixas>`_

`2024.05.2`_ - 2024/05/09
-------------------------
Fixed
~~~~~
* Add `typing-extensions` as explicit dependency for Python < 3.11 to support the `Self` type.

`2024.05.1`_ - 2024/05/09
-------------------------
Changed
~~~~~~~
* Remove custom collection logic of the bank registry for ``pyinstaller``. The changes introduced in
  `#92 <https://github.com/mdomke/schwifty/pull/92>`_ were wrong and have been reverted. Usage
  example

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ pyinstaller <script> --collect-data schwifty --copy-metadata schwifty

`2024.05.0`_ - 2024/05/07
-------------------------
Fixed
~~~~~
* Loading JSON data into a Pydantic model with an ``IBAN`` or ``BIC``-field
  (``Model.model_validate_json()``) was previously broken and has been fixed now.

Added
~~~~~
* JSON schema generation for Pydantic models.

Changed
~~~~~~~
* Updated bank registries.
* Remove the dependency to ``iso3166`` since its functionallity is already covered by ``pycountry``


`2024.04.0`_ - 2024/04/18
-------------------------
Added
~~~~~
* Added Revolut Bank for Spain `@brunovilla <https://github.com/brunovila>`_
* Added support for Python 3.12
* Added manually curated bank registry for Montenegro `@Djuka <https://github.com/Djuka>`_

Changed
~~~~~~~
* The bank registry is now internally validated, so that all domestic bank codes actaully match the
  specification of the corresponding BBAN structure. As a result some entries had to be removed,
  because they did contain invalid bank codes.
* The Danish national checksum algorithm is considered opaque and the checksum digit is assumed to
  be part of the account number (which is now always 10 digits long).

Fixed
~~~~~
* The Czech bank registry was stored in latin-1 encoding while being read as UTF-8. This resulted
  in invalid bank names `@Natim <https://github.com/Natim>`_ and
  `@Cogax <https://github.com/Cogax>`_.
* The Norwegian national checksum algorithm was rendering wrong results in some edge-cases
  `@Natim <https://github.com/Natim>`_

  * Andorra
  * Arabic Emirates
  * Costa Rica
  * Portugal

* New attributes :attr:`.IBAN.account_id`, :attr:`.IBAN.account_holder_id` and
  :attr:`.IBAN.account_type` that are available depending on the country's BBAN specification.
  E.g. :attr:`.IBAN.account_holder_id` is currently only available for Iceland (Kennitala) and only
  Brazil defines an :attr:`.IBAN.account_id`.

Changed
~~~~~~~
* Use enhanced IBAN/BBAN format from `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number#IBAN_formats_by_country>`_,
  since the official information from SWIFT is often inacurate.
* The support for national checksum digits has been reimplemented.
* The :class:`.IBAN`-class now has an additional :attr:`.IBAN.bban`-attribute, where all country
  specific functionality has been moved to.

-------------------------
Changed
~~~~~~~
* The validation of a :class:`.BIC` is now performed in the context of ISO 9362:2022 which allows
  numbers in the business party prefix. If strict SWIFT compliance is reqruied the
  ``enforce_swift_compliance`` parameter can be set to ``True``.
* The :meth:`.BIC.from_bank_code`-method will now select the most generic BIC (e.g. with no branch
  specifier or the "XXX" value) if multiple BICs are associated to the given domestic bank code.
  `@Natim <https://github.com/Natim>`_.
* Many manually curated bank registry entries have been re-added by `@dennisxtria <https://github.com/dennisxtria>`_

`2023.10.0`_ - 2023/10/31
-------------------------
Added
~~~~~~~

  can be directly used as type annotations in `Pydantic models <https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/#basic-model-usage>`_

Changed
~~~~~~~
* The :class:`.IBAN` and :class:`.BIC` classes are now subclasses of :class:`str` so that all string
  related methods and functionallities (e.g. slicing) are directly available.

`2023.09.0`_ - 2023/09/25
-------------------------
Removed
~~~~~~~
* Support for Python 3.7 has been dropped.

* Updated bank registry for Austria, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Hungary, Netherlands and Poland.

`2022.07.1`_ - 2022/28/07
-------------------------
Fixed
~~~~~
* In some countries the BBAN does not include a bank code, but only a branch code (e.g. Poland). In
  those cases the branch code should be used to lookup the bank associated to an IBAN instead of the
  obviously empty bank code.

`2022.07.0`_ - 2022/07/07
-------------------------
Fixed
~~~~~
* Hungarian bank registry generator script was fixed by `@Krystofee <https://github.com/Krystofee>`_

`2022.06.3`_ - 2022/06/29
-------------------------
Added
~~~~~

`2022.04.2`_ - 2022/04/29
-------------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~
* Allow getting bank names from IBAN. Previously, you could do ``iban.bic.bank_names[0]``, but since
  a BIC can be associated to multiple bank codes the context of the specific bank is lost and you
  could end up with the wrong bank name. `@jose-reveni <https://github.com/jose-reveni>`_


`2022.04.1`_ - 2022/04/29
-------------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Manually curated entries for banks from Iceland `@gautinils <https://github.com/gautinils>`_

Changed
~~~~~~~
* Removed manually curated bank entries for Spain since all values were already part of
  the generated registry.
* Updated bank registry for Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, Netherlands and Poland
* Added overwrite for IBAN spec of Czech Republic and France. The branch and account code positions
  are wrongly provided in the official IBAN registry.

-------------------------

Added
~~~~~
* Added 440 additional bank records for Spain.

`2021.10.1`_ - 2021/10/11
-------------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~
* Use `importlib.resources <https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/importlib.html#module-importlib.resources>`_
  for loading internal registries. This removes the need to have ``setuptools`` installed.
  Thank you `@a-recknagel <https://github.com/a-recknagel>`_ for the idea!

Fixed
~~~~~
* Ensure that Belgian BBAN checksums are always 2 digits long.

`2021.10.0`_ - 2021/10/01
-------------------------

Added
~~~~~
* Added IBAN spec for Sudan (SD).
* Added and extended manually curated bank entries for Turkey, Italy, Israel, Ireland, Spain,
  Switzerland and Denmark `@howorkon <https://github.com/howorkon>`_.

Changed
~~~~~~~
* Updated bank registry for Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Netherlands, Poland,
  Slovenia and Slovakia.

Fixed
~~~~~
* Disallow ``schwifty`` to be installed for Python versions older than 3.7. It was unsupported
  before but is now rejected upon installation with an appropriate error message.
* Austrian bank codes are now consistently left padded with zeros. This fixes the mapping from
  IBAN to BIC for the Austrian federal bank institutes.

`2021.06.1`_ - 2021/06/24
-------------------------

Added
~~~~~
* Enable tool based type checking as described in `PEP-0561`_ by adding the ``py.typed`` marker
  `@jmfederico <https://github.com/jmfederico>`_


`2021.06.0`_ - 2021/06/17
-------------------------

* Country specifc checksum validation for Belgian banks, as well as support for generating the
  checksum when using the :meth:`.IBAN.generate`-method. `@mhemeryck <https://github.com/mhemeryck>`_

`2021.05.1`_ - 2021/05/20
-------------------------

Added
~~~~~
* The IBAN validation now optionally includes the verification of the country specific checksum
  within the BBAN. This currently works for German and Italian banks. For German banks the checksum
  algorithm for the account code is chosen by the bank code. Since there are over 150 bank specific
  algorithms in Germany not all of them are implemented at the moment, but the majority of banks
  should be covered.

Changed
~~~~~~~
* Update bank registry for Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Austria and Netherlands.

`2021.05.0`_ - 2021/05/02
-------------------------

Added

Changed
~~~~~~~
* Restructure documentation and change theme to `furo <https://pradyunsg.me/furo/>`_.
* Added dedicated exception classes for various validation errors.
* Drop support for Python 2. Only Python 3.6+ will be supported from now on.
