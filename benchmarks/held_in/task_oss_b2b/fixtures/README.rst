Gotta get schwifty with your IBANs
==================================

.. teaser-begin

``schwifty`` is a Python library that let's you easily work with IBANs and BICs
as specified by the ISO. IBAN is the Internation Bank Account Number and BIC
the Business Identifier Code. Both are used for international money transfer.

Features
--------

``schwifty`` lets you

* `validate`_ check-digits and the country specific format of IBANs
* `validate`_ format and country codes from BICs
* `generate`_ BICs from country and bank-code
* `generate`_ IBANs from country-code, bank-code and account-number.
* `generate`_ random valid IBANs
* get the BIC associated to an IBAN's bank-code
* access all relevant components as attributes

See the `docs <https://schwifty.readthedocs.io>`_ for more inforamtion.

Versioning
----------

Since the IBAN specification and the mapping from BIC to bank_code is updated from time to time,
``schwifty`` uses `CalVer <http://www.calver.org/>`_ for versioning with the scheme ``YY.0M.Micro``.


.. installation-begin

Installation
------------

To install ``schwifty``, simply:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install schwifty

.. installation-end


Development
-----------

The only prerequisite to work on ``schwifty`` is `uv`_. Running ``uv sync`` creates a virtual
environment with all development dependencies (including the tools mentioned below).

We use `ruff`_ as code formatter and linter. This avoids discussions about style preferences in the
same way as ``gofmt`` does the job for Golang. The conformance to the formatting rules is checked in
the CI pipeline, so that it is recommendable to install the configured `prek`_-hook, in order
to avoid long feedback-cycles.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ uv sync
   $ uv run prek install

You can also run ``uv run poe fmt`` to format the code or use one of the available `editor
integrations`_. See the `contributing guide`_ for the full list of development commands and the
contribution workflow.


Project Information
-------------------

``schwifty`` is released under `MIT`_ license and its documentation lives at `Read the Docs`_. The
code is maintained on `GitHub`_ and packages are distributed on `PyPI`_

Name
~~~~

Since ``swift`` and ``swiftly`` were already taken by the OpenStack-project, but we somehow wanted
to point out the connection to SWIFT, Rick and Morty came up with the idea to name the project
``schwifty``.
